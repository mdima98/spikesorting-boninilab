# spikesorting-boninilab

This repository contains code and relevant files for the spike sorting pipeline conducted at the Laboratory of Neuroethology of Non-Human Primates ([BoniniLab](https://boninilab.unipr.it/en/)) at the University of Parma. Most scripts and software here will be written in Python and MATLAB.

Aside from custom made scripts and code to do pre- and post- processing on the data, the main software used to perform spike sorting and the related analyses are [SpikeInterface](https://github.com/spikeinterface), [kilosort4](https://github.com/MouseLand/Kilosort) and [phy2](https://github.com/cortex-lab/phy).
